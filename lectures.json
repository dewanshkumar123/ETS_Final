      "transcript": "1. The Problem and the Context\r\nMany students at IIT Gandhinagar struggle to keep up during fast, concept heavy lectures. Some students are especially disadvantaged.\r\nAfter the class, revision depends heavily on whatever the student managed to scribble in a notebook. There is usually no official record of what exactly was said in class, aside from occasional slides. This reinforces existing inequalities: students who are already confident and quick benefit more from the live lecture, while others silently fall behind.\r\nSo the core educational problem at IIT Gandhinagar is:\r\nHow can live lectures become more accessible, reviewable, and supportive for diverse learners, without placing an unrealistic burden on teachers?\r\n\r\n2. Whose Problem Is It?\r\nThis is primarily a problem for:\r\nStudents who:\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss parts of the lecture because of pace, distraction, or anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\nStruggle to take complete and organized notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers who:\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to support all students but do not have time to create perfect notes, transcripts, and personalized explanations for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannot easily see who is lost in real time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe institution (IITGN) which:\r\n\r\n\r\nAims to provide inclusive and high quality education.\r\n\r\n\r\nWants to support diverse learning needs without massively increasing workload or costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

Sociotechnical Analysis\r\n5.1 What New Problems Might This Create?\r\nOver dependence on AI notes\r\n Students may stop paying attention in class, expecting the app to provide everything.\r\nErosion of informal teacher student interaction\r\nReliance on the chatbot can reduce questions in class and weaken classroom community.\r\nInaccuracies and hallucinations\r\n AI notes can misinterpret content, leading students to learn incorrect or oversimplified material.\r\nSurveillance concerns\r\n Constant audio capture can feel like monitoring, even if only the teacher\u2019s mic is used.\r\nData privacy and control\r\n Unclear ownership and reuse of lecture transcripts may make teachers worry about losing control of their content.\r\n5.2 Who Might Be Harmed?\r\nTeachers:\r\n\r\n\r\nMay feel pressured to perform \u201cperfect\u201d lectures because everything is captured and structured.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay fear that their teaching can be monitored, compared, or evaluated quantitatively based on transcripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon native English speakers among faculty:\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech recognition systems typically work better on certain accents. Misrecognition may disproportionately affect particular teachers, making them look unclear or less competent.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3 Changes in Language and Classroom Culture\r\nThe technology promotes a view of education where:\r\nLectures become \u201ccontent streams\u201d to be captured, transcribed, and mined.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpontaneous board work, stories, and informal explanations are turned into \u201cdata\u201d for AI.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents may shift vocabulary from \u201cWhat did you understand?\u201d to \u201cWhat did the model generate?\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.4 Shifts in Economic and Political Power\r\nPlatform power:\r\n Whoever controls the software and data gains influence over teaching practices and intellectual property.\r\n\r\n\r\nStandardization of teaching:\r\n AI-friendly lecture formats may pressure teachers to conform, reducing pedagogical diversity.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent agency:\r\n Students get more review support but may become dependent on an opaque system they can\u2019t easily challenge.\r\n\r\n6. Alternative Uses and Design Choices\r\nThe same core technology can be used in different ways:\r\nAs a support tool that students can toggle on or off, rather than a mandatory layer for all lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor accessibility first, for example for students with hearing impairments or those who miss a class for health reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a teacher facing tool that first gives the instructor a private summary of the lecture, which they can edit before sharing with students, maintaining their authority and control.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese choices reflect different values and power relations.\r\n\r\n7.

Introduction to Graphs\r\nDefinition (Long & Precise)\r\n\r\nA graph is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relationships between objects.\r\nIt consists of:\r\n\r\nA set of vertices (also called nodes or points), usually denoted V\r\n\r\nA set of edges (also called links or lines), usually denoted E\r\n\r\nEach edge connects one vertex to another, representing a relationship, connection, or interaction.\r\nGraphs can represent networks, maps, social links, computer systems, biology, and more.\r\n\r\nVisual Example\r\nA --- B\r\n|     |\r\nD --- C\r\n\r\n\r\nHere:\r\nV = {A, B, C, D}\r\nE = {AB, BC, CD, DA}\r\n\r\n2. Types of Graphs\r\n2.1 Undirected Graph\r\n\r\nAn undirected graph is a graph where edges have no direction.\r\nIf vertices A and B are connected, you can travel both ways.\r\n\r\nLong definition:\r\nAn undirected graph is a graph G = (V, E) where each edge e \u2208 E is an unordered pair {u, v}, meaning the connection between u and v is symmetric.\r\n\r\n2.2 Directed Graph (Digraph)\r\n\r\nA directed graph has edges with direction (arrows).\r\n\r\nLong definition:\r\nA directed graph is a structure G = (V, E) where each edge e \u2208 E is an ordered pair (u \u2192 v), representing a one-way relationship such as influence, hierarchy, or flow.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nA \u2192 B \u2192 C\r\n\r\n2.3 Weighted Graph\r\n\r\nA weighted graph assigns numerical values (weights/costs) to edges.\r\n\r\nUse cases: road distances, network latency, cost optimization.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nA --5-- B --2-- C\r\n\r\n3. Graph Representations\r\n3.1 Adjacency List\r\n\r\nEach vertex stores a list of its neighbors.\r\n\r\nPython code:\r\n\r\ngraph = {\r\n    'A': ['B', 'D'],\r\n    'B': ['A', 'C'],\r\n    'C': ['B', 'D'],\r\n    'D': ['A', 'C']\r\n}\r\n\r\n3.2 Adjacency Matrix\r\n\r\nA matrix showing which vertices are connected.\r\n\r\n    A B C D\r\nA   0 1 0 1\r\nB   1 0 1 0\r\nC   0 1 0 1\r\nD   1 0 1 0\r\n\r\n\r\nPython code:\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nmatrix = np.array([\r\n    [0,1,0,1],\r\n    [1,0,1,0],\r\n    [0,1,0,1],\r\n    [1,0,1,0]\r\n])\r\n\r\n4. Graph Traversal Algorithms\r\n4.1 BFS (Breadth-First Search)\r\n\r\nLong definition:\r\nBFS explores a graph level-by-level, starting at a source vertex, visiting all its neighbors before moving deeper.\r\nIt uses a queue, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\r\n\r\nPython BFS\r\nfrom collections import deque\r\n\r\ndef bfs(graph, start):\r\n    visited = set()\r\n    queue = deque([start])\r\n\r\n    while queue:\r\n        node = queue.popleft()\r\n        if node not in visited:\r\n            visited.add(node)\r\n            print(node)\r\n            queue.extend(graph[node])\r\n\r\n4.2 DFS (Depth-First Search)\r\n\r\nLong definition:\r\nDFS explores a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.\r\nIt uses a stack (either manual or recursion).\r\nUseful for cycle detection, topological sorting, and exploring components.\r\n\r\nPython DFS\r\ndef dfs(graph, node, visited=None):\r\n    if visited is None:\r\n        visited = set()\r\n\r\n    if node not in visited:\r\n        visited.add(node)\r\n        print(node)\r\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\r\n            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)\r\n\r\n5.

Precise)\r \r A graph is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relationships between objects\n- It consists of:\r \r A set of vertices (also called nodes or points), usually denoted V\r \r A set of edges (also called links or lines), usually denoted E\r \r Each edge connects one vertex to another, representing a relationship, connection, or interaction\n- Graphs can represent networks, maps, social links, computer systems, biology, and more\n- Visual Example\r A --- B\r |     |\r D --- C\r \r \r Here:\r V = {A, B, C, D}\r E = {AB, BC, CD, DA}\r \r 2\n- Types of Graphs\r 2\n- 1 Undirected Graph\r \r An undirected graph is a graph where edges have no direction\n- If vertices A and B are connected, you can travel both ways\n- Long definition:\r An undirected graph is a graph G = (V, E) where each edge e \u2208 E is an unordered pair {u, v}, meaning the connection between u and v is symmetric\n- 2\n- 2 Directed Graph (Digraph)\r \r A directed graph has edges with direction (arrows)\n- Long definition:\r A directed graph is a structure G = (V, E) where each edge e \u2208 E is an ordered pair (u \u2192 v), representing a one-way relationship such as influence, hierarchy, or flow\n- Example\r \r A \u2192 B \u2192 C\r \r 2\n- 3 Weighted Graph\r \r A weighted graph assigns numerical values (weights/costs) to edges\n- Use cases: road distances, network latency, cost optimization\n- Example:\r \r A --5-- B --2-- C\r \r 3\n- Graph Representations\r 3\n- 1 Adjacency List\r \r Each vertex stores a list of its neighbors\n- Python code:\r \r graph = {\r     'A': ['B', 'D'],\r     'B': ['A', 'C'],\r     'C': ['B', 'D'],\r     'D': ['A', 'C']\r }\r \r 3\n- 2 Adjacency Matrix\r \r A matrix showing which vertices are connected\n- A B C D\r A   0 1 0 1\r B   1 0 1 0\r C   0 1 0 1\r D   1 0 1 0\r \r \r Python code:\r \r import numpy as np\r \r matrix = np\n- array([\r     [0,1,0,1],\r     [1,0,1,0],\r     [0,1,0,1],\r     [1,0,1,0]\r ])\r \r 4\n- Graph Traversal Algorithms\r 4\n- 1 BFS (Breadth-First Search)\r \r Long definition:\r BFS explores a graph level-by-level, starting at a source vertex, visiting all its neighbors before moving deeper\n- It uses a queue, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs\n- Python BFS\r from collections import deque\r \r def bfs(graph, start):\r     visited = set()\r     queue = deque([start])\r \r     while queue:\r         node = queue\n- popleft()\r         if node not in visited:\r             visited\n- add(node)\r             print(node)\r             queue\n- extend(graph[node])\r \r 4\n- 2 DFS (Depth-First Search)\r \r Long definition:\r DFS explores a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking\n- It uses a stack (either manual or recursion)\n- Useful for cycle detection, topological sorting, and exploring components\n- Python DFS\r def dfs(graph, node, visited=None):\r     if visited is None:\r         visited = set()\r \r     if node not in visited:\r         visited\n- add(node)\r         print(node)\r         for neighbor in graph[node]:\r             dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)\r \r 5\n- Paths & Cycles\r Path (Long definition)\r \r A path is a sequence of vertices in which each consecutive pair is connected by an edge\n- Cycle (Long definition)\r \r A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated edges\n- Example:\r \r A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 A\r \r 6\n- Eulerian & Hamiltonian Concepts\r 6\n- 1 Eulerian Path & Cycle\r \r Eulerian Path: visits every edge exactly once\r \r Eulerian Cycle: starts and ends at same vertex, visiting every edge once\r \r Condition (undirected):\r \r Eulerian cycle: every vertex has even degree\r \r Eulerian path: exactly 0 or 2 vertices have odd degree\r \r 6\n- 2 Hamiltonian Path & Cycle\r \r Visits every vertex exactly once\r \r Much harder to determine (NP-complete)\r \r 7\n- Shortest Path Algorithms\r 7\n- 1 Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm\r \r Long definition:\r Dijkstra's algorithm computes the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights, using a greedy strategy and a priority queue\n- Python Dijkstra (simple version)\r import heapq\r \r def dijkstra(graph, start):\r     pq = [(0, start)]\r     dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}\r     dist[start] = 0\r \r     while pq:\r         cost, node = heapq\n- heappop(pq)\r \r         if cost > dist[node]:\r             continue\r \r         for neighbor, weight in graph[node]\n- items():\r             new_cost = cost + weight\r             if new_cost < dist[neighbor]:\r                 dist[neighbor] = new_cost\r                 heapq\n- heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor))\r \r     return dist\r \r 8\n- Minimum Spanning Tree
